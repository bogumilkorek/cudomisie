## Cudomisie
Laravel 5.4 + some Javascript/jQuery e-commerce website.

## 1. Features
Description comming soon

## 2. Todo
- More tests
- Code refactoring
- Extend dropzone with drag and drop
- Navigation CRUD with drag and drop

## 3. Tests
I've written a couple of browser tests using Laravel Dusk. To run them type:
`php artisan dusk`

To run single test you need to provide it's full path:
`php artisan dusk tests\browser\OrderTest.php`

I'm planning to add more tests soon, using pure PHPUnit as well (Dusk is pretty slow ATM).

## 4. Installation
Description comming soon
